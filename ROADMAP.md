# 🛠️ RoleWorld Engine – Development Roadmap

This roadmap provides a step-by-step technical plan to implement the RoleWorld Engine from core logic to usable GUI tools. The goal is to start small, test internal logic early, and grow toward a modular and living system.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 — Core Loop & Simulation Skeleton

> *Focus: Engine heartbeat, entity system, and simulation clock.*

* [ ] Create application window (Silk.NET.Windowing)
* [ ] Implement the main loop (`HandleInput`, `UpdateSimulation`, `Render`)
* [ ] Add time management: `Tick`, `DeltaTime`, and pause/resume
* [ ] Build a minimal `Entity` structure with unique ID
* [ ] Implement component storage (dictionary-based)
* [ ] Create a `World` class to manage all entities and systems

---

## 🧱 Phase 2 — Entities & Components Design

> *Focus: Make the world data-driven and modular.*

* [ ] Define core components:

  * [ ] `Position`
  * [ ] `Name`
  * [ ] `Faction`
  * [ ] `Age`
* [ ] Add basic entity factory methods (create character, faction, town)
* [ ] Implement serialization-friendly data structures

---

## 🌀 Phase 3 — Systems & World Simulation

> *Focus: Run logic across the world each tick.*

* [ ] Create tick-based systems:

  * [ ] `AgeSystem` (increment age)
  * [ ] `MovementSystem` (random movement)
  * [ ] `EventSystem` (chance-based events)
* [ ] Build a `SimulationEngine` class to manage all systems
* [ ] Log simulation steps to console for debugging (no GUI yet)

---

## 💾 Phase 4 — Persistence Layer

> *Focus: Save/load the entire world state.*

* [ ] Implement a JSON-based save system
* [ ] Store all entities and components with metadata
* [ ] Add versioning to saves for future compatibility
* [ ] Load saved state into the `World` cleanly

---

## 🗺️ Phase 5 — World Map (Visual Placeholder)

> *Focus: Visual context of the world, non-interactive.*

* [ ] Initialize OpenGL 2D context with Silk.NET
* [ ] Draw a static tiled map or background
* [ ] Render `Position` components as dots/entities
* [ ] Camera: Pan and Zoom support

---

## 🖱️ Phase 6 — Input & Entity Selection

> *Focus: Interact with the map.*

* [ ] Capture mouse input & map coordinates
* [ ] Click to select an entity on the map
* [ ] Display data in console (or temporary overlay panel)
* [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for debug (pause, tick step)

---

## 🪟 Phase 7 — GUI Layer

> *Focus: Build the windowing system and basic panels.*

* [ ] Design minimal immediate-mode UI framework
* [ ] Create resizable, draggable windows
* [ ] Create entity inspection panel (name, stats, etc.)
* [ ] Implement context menus / actions

---

## 🔃 Phase 8 — Dynamic Events & AI Decisions

> *Focus: Add systems that simulate autonomy and consequence.*

* [ ] Add a basic event system (births, deaths, alliances)
* [ ] Create a `DecisionSystem` for autonomous character actions
* [ ] Log events and decisions chronologically
* [ ] Prepare GUI event history/log panel

---

## 📚 Phase 9 — Documentation & Developer Tooling

> *Focus: Prepare for open contribution and scaling.*

* [ ] Generate code documentation
* [ ] Create usage examples (code + screenshots)
* [ ] Write contributing guide
* [ ] Add test scenes or simulation presets

---

## 🔮 Long-Term Ideas (Post-MVP)

* [ ] Procedural map generation
* [ ] Dynastic bloodline simulation
* [ ] Faction reputation and diplomatic memory
* [ ] Crime, culture, religion systems
* [ ] Modding support (JSON or scripting)

---

## 🧭 Final Note

> Build systems first. GUI later. Everything observable via logs before UI.

This roadmap is iterative — each phase builds upon the last. Small victories (like a character aging or a faction forming) are already wins.

Stay modular. Stay systemic. Let the world live without you.
