**RoleWorld Engine** is a handcrafted 2D game engine written in C# (.NET 8+) using Silk.NET.  
It is designed to build systemic, persistent, and fully GUI-based role-playing simulations where every character, faction, and event evolves autonomously, independently from the player.

This project serves as a platform to create deep, emergent RPGs and strategic simulations with complete freedom and modularity.

## Why RoleWorld Engine?

- **Living simulation**: The world is always active and evolving, with AI-controlled characters and events that progress independently of the player.  
- **Total freedom**: No fixed classes or scripted paths each entity acts independently in a complex system.    
- **Modular design**: Easily extend, tweak, and integrate into your projects with clear, handcrafted architecture.

## Key Features

- Procedural strategic map generation (islands, biomes, terrain)  
- Entity system with traits, relationships, and social dynamics  
- Complex event handling and AI decision-making  
- Full persistence: save and load the evolving world state  
- Optimized 2D rendering via Silk.NET (OpenGL, GLFW)  
- Tools for sandbox RPGs and political simulations
