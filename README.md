**RoleWorld Engine** is a 2D game engine written in C# using Silk.NET.  
It is designed for building systemic, persistent, and GUI-based role-playing simulations â€” where the world evolves independently of the player.

This project focuses on modular simulation, emergent behavior, and custom UI logic without any 3D rendering or visual editors.

## Features

- System-driven world simulation
- Custom 2D GUI
- Entity-based design: characters, factions, traits
- Strategic map navigation
- Event-driven logic and AI decision-making
- Full persistence (save/load)

---

## Technologies

- **Language**: C# (.NET 8+)
- **Low-level API**: [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET)  
  (OpenGL, GLFW, Input)
- **Rendering**: Immediate-mode 2D graphics
- **Architecture**: Fully handcrafted engine (no third-party engine layer)
