# 🧩 RoleWorld Engine

> A systemic 2D engine for living RPGs — written in C# with Silk.NET.

**RoleWorld Engine** is a handcrafted simulation engine designed to build living, breathing worlds where kingdoms rise, characters evolve, and stories emerge — without scripts, without classes, without 3D.

Built for those who want to craft **entire worlds** from logic, rules, and interaction.

## 🎮 What makes it different?

- **No 3D. No prefab scenes. No WYSIWYG.**  
  Everything is coded. Everything is yours.

- **The world lives without the player.**  
  Entities act, think, evolve — independently.

- **Complete GUI interface.**  
  Strategy, diplomacy, trade, wars — all through windows, maps, panels.

- **Persistent and replayable.**  
  Save the world. Reload it. Let it grow again — differently.

## 💡 Philosophy

> This is not a game.  
> It’s a **canvas** for games.  
> A place where systems speak louder than scripts.  
> A **toolbox for systemic storytelling**.
